Hello Everyone

This project uses Kociemba module to solve the rubiks cube it was prepared around 2 years back and I believe it will only work in linux (Cause I have not tried this in windows yet)
During the developement of this project, I tried to solve the case where the user has made the wrong move even after seeing the on screen instruction the program should be able to know that and inform user about the same
( and if possible tell the user the what was the wrong move and how to correct it)

I thought of solving it but couldn't do so
Hence asking for your help

thank you in advance :)
